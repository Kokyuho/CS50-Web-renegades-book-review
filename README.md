# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

BOOK REVIEW WEBSITE

In this project I have created a book review website. The website works according to the project requirements.

A video was recorded with a demonstration of functionality.

Raw SQL commands are kept as requested via db.execute.

Bootstrap was used, as well as a background image, to make the website nicer.

The footer has no functionality, it is only for templating purposes.

The project folder structure is as follows:

project1:
|--application.py // here the main flask application.
|--import.py // this script must run at the beginning to import books.csv to our database
|--books.csv // contains a database of books
|--requirements.txt // contains the python packages that must be installed
|--README.md // this readme
|--(templates) // contains html templates
|--(static) // contains the image and css file
